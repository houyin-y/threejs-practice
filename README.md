# Three.js Practice

This repository contains my personal experiments and practice projects using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a powerful JavaScript 3D library. I'm exploring the fundamentals of WebGL and interactive 3D graphics through hands-on examples and small demos.

---

## 🧪 What I've Practiced So Far

- Setting up a basic Three.js scene (scene, camera, renderer)
- Creating 3D shapes like cubes, spheres and planes
- Adding lighting (ambient, directional, point, spot, hemisphere lights)
- Using OrbitControls and PointLockControls camera interaction and controls
- Applying materials (MeshBasicMaterial, MeshPhongMaterial)
- Animating objects with render loop
